Structural Model of the Universe Based on Spherical Voids

1. Proposal

We propose that the universe consists of spherical voids organized in a densest sphere packing structure with 12 contact points per void.

⸻

2. Undetermined Structural Mode

It remains to be determined whether this structure represents:
	1.	A fixed lattice used as a computational structure with 12 gates per void, or
	2.	A flexible foam capable of reorganizing, merging, and separating to form matter structures such as quarks and atoms.

⸻

3. Dynamic Behavior (Assuming Foam Model)

In the foam interpretation, electrons and photons propagate within the spherical voids.
They transition through the 12 gates in an oscillating pattern, allowing for a 90-degree vector alignment between a hypothetical electric and magnetic subsphere.

⸻

4. Quantum Liquid

The interstitial space between the spherical voids is filled with a quantum liquid.
This liquid applies compressive pressure, holding the structure together.
This pressure is interpreted as gravity.

⸻

5. Observational Basis

Observational data shows that the universe exhibits a foamy large-scale structure.

Dark matter may be interpreted as the quantum liquid, existing outside human perception and detection.

⸻

6. Register Potential

The structure supports a three-dimensional shifting register architecture.
Each spherical void behaves as a node with 12 directional gates, suitable for information transfer or physical excitation.

⸻

7. Internal Gate Mechanism

Each void acts as a spherical condenser.
The gates operate as field-effect transistors (FETs), with control lines existing between the spherical voids.

⸻

8. Optical Addressing in Transparent Media

In transparent media, RGB-based control could selectively address the gates.
	•	Three faces of a cube apply RGB input, enabling color mixing–based selection of individual gates.
	•	The remaining three cube faces may serve as input/output terminals for charge or signal injection.
